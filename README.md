# Python-Contest-Practice
These are some of the algorithms I wrote, and the first ones I uploaded were the ones I wrote before. Many of them are missing because my computer suddenly broke down. Also, THERE are some interesting python things I wrote myself, but they are three or four years old so it's very simple, just to keep track of.
Due to the computer breakdown, I did not have files for many advanced algorithms related to data structures. Such as knapsack algorithm, width first search, depth first search algorithm. I didn't participate in any more algorithm competitions.
